    %h1 Code of Conduct

    %p
      Part of ensuring that Demuxed is a good experience for all attendees is the enforcement of a strong code of conduct. All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at Demuxed are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will strongly enforce this code throughout the event and all attendees must agree to this policy when purchasing tickets. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe and inclusive environment for everybody.

      Demuxed is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter, and other online media. Demuxed participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.
