      %li.no-marketing
        %h3 No paid content, ever.
        %p
          Speakers are selected based on their submission, not how much money their company paid; we will never, ever sell a speaking slot. Attendee information isn't for sale either, and that includes any sponsors.
      %li.affordable
        %h3 Affordable.
        %p
          We want anyone in the industry to be able to come, which means keeping tickets reasonably priced (thanks largely to our generous sponsors). We also offer free and discounted tickets to students and open source contributors, so please <a href="mailto:info@demuxed.com">reach out</a> if you're interested.
      %li.for-everyone
        %h3 For everyone in the community.
        %p
          Our community is dedicated to providing an inclusive, enjoyable experience for everyone in the video industry. In this pursuit, and in keeping with our love for reasonable standards, we adopted the Ada Initiative's <a href="/code-of-conduct.html">Conf Code of Conduct</a>.

        %p
          We take our talk selection and schedule-building process very seriously. This year we received over <strong>100</strong> talk submissions, and <strong>27</strong> individuals from across the online video industry reviewed those (anonymized) submissions for a total of nearly <strong>1300</strong> reviews. A smaller group from that committee then took those aggregated reviews and helped pick the very best schedule possible, optimizing for talks that are relevant, interesting, and diverse.

        %p
          Keep in mind, the individual session times and their order are subject to change, so make sure to check back here for any updates.

        Bespoke, SF

      %p
        Busting at the seams in venues is a great problem to have, but this year we wanted to make sure we had plenty of room to breathe. In addition to being right in the heart of downtown next to BART and Muni, Bespoke is large, configurable and high-tech, with a production room and multiple, dedicated internet connections (shout out to all the people that tried to watch the live stream last year).

      %p
        Bespoke is located inside Westfield San Francisco Centre on Level 4 next to Bloomingdale’s Westfield San Francisco Centre

      About

        Demuxed

    %div.about-us__text
      %p
        Demuxed is simply engineers talking about video technology. After years of chatting about video at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SF-Video-Technology/">SF Video Technology Meetup</a>, we decided it was time for an engineer-first event with quality technical talks about video. Our focus has traditionally been on content delivered over the web, but topics cover anything from encoding to playback and more!

      %h3 Yeah but who are <span style="text-decoration:underline">you</span>?
      %p
        Most of the organization and work behind the scenes is done by folks from <a href="https://mux.com">Mux</a> (Demuxed came first ☝️) but none of this would be possible without amazing people from the meetup.

      %p
        Every year we get a group together that's kind enough to do things like schedule planning, help brainstorm cool swag, and, most importantly, argue heatedly over which talk submissions should make the final cut.
