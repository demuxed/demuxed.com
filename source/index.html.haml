      Next year will see widespread availability of a new creative canvas (High Dynamic Range, Wider Colors),
      a new royalty-free codec (AV-1) and a new royalty-free image format (AVIF). These new technologies offer
      great opportunities for creating new immersive experiences, both in content itself and in discovery/user
      interfaces. What are some of the challenges when we move from "find, click, play" to a rich, seamless
      and dynamic auto-playing user experience ? How will these new technologies help - and hinder - that evolution?

      In this talk, we will examine FFmpeg as a live-stream RTMP-to-HLS transcoder and provide some insight
      on how to operate the tool. Such a solution is simple to deploy but has a few technical issues, such
      as segment misalignment, unnecessary performance sacrifice, and a lack of flexibility to support our
      product features. Therefore, Twitch has implemented its own in-house transcoder software stack called
      TwitchTranscoder, which runs in a custom designed threading model and outputs N variants in a
      single process.

      S-frame (Switching Frame) was added to the AV1 video encoder to allow shorter segments in ABR, enabling
      low latency  live streaming without the burden of using  bit-consuming IDR frames. Segments will be allowed
      to start with S-frame and video player could switch, decode and play at any segment boundary. This talk will
      cover specifics of S-frame and show how up to 20% bitrate savings could be achieved on top of AV1 encoder.

      earlier standards have more or less converged into a primary patent pool, patent holders claiming

      also audio is an important factor for an immersive experience. In this talk I will show how ambisonic

      "surround" sound.

      IP is the future. But they’re not just talking about delivery, they’re talking about using IP for live production
      of content instead of current technologies such as satellite and SDI. This presentation will explain how

      Tuning ABR starts off with broad strokes, but perfecting it can require a second-by-second understanding

      so we can spot useful improvements (harder).

      We've implemented a scene detection framework that segments videos into logical story units without the
      need for a human editor. We achieve this in two steps: 1) we train a deep-learning model to learn a distance
      measure (i.e. similarity measure) between all pairs of shots by leveraging visual, audio, and textual
      features extracted from the video; 2) we then cluster contiguous groups of shots into scenes based on
      the full similarity matrix of shots.

      Since Netflix started using ‘per-title encoding’, optimizing the encoding recipe for the content has
      become a well-known concept. But what if a similar approach could be applied to every scene on the
      client side using the adaptation logic? Many low complexity scenes do not need to be streamed at a
      high bitrate to maintain a consistent perceptual quality for the viewer. These sequences can be replaced
      by lower bitrate segments, saving bandwidth and reducing costs, if the client is aware of the video
      context and not only the bitrate of a segment.

        Demuxed is simply engineers talking about video technology. After years of chatting about video at the
        %a{href:"http://www.meetup.com/SF-Video-Technology/"} SF Video Technology Meetup,
        we decided it was time for an engineer-first event with quality technical talks about video. Our focus has traditionally been
        on content delivered over the web, but topics cover anything from encoding to playback and more!

      %h3
        Who's organizing this?

      %p
        Most of the organization and work behind the scenes is done by folks from

        (Demuxed came first ☝️) but none of this would be possible without amazing people from the meetup.

      %p
        Every year we get a group together that's
        kind enough to do things like schedule planning, help brainstorm cool swag, and, most importantly,
        argue heatedly over which talk submissions should make the final cut.

        When the dust has settled and the talks are done, Brightcove is sponsoring an after party! This year's festivities
        are downstairs in the same venue, so we can just head straight there to enjoy some food and drinks after the conference.
        The schedule is <em>packed</em>, so this is the perfect opportunity to unwind and catch up with all your fellow attendees.

      %p
        The only thing you need to get in is your badge, so make sure to bring it with you. Plus ones are welcome to
        come join!
