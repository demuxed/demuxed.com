Well hello there! It's the April newsletter, although technically you'll probably get it in May. Some general newsletter-specific notes before we jump into the rest of this one:

- We send ~one newsletter a month. Usually there's some kind of Demuxed news (CFPs are open, CFPs are closing, tickets are on sale, a rare podcast episode appears, etc), then some industry bites and upcoming community events that we're aware of.
- If you like it so much you want to share it with friends and colleagues, you can use this link.
- If you don't want to get these emails anymore, we'll be v sad, but we also get it. You can unsubscribe here, and you're welcome to come back whenever you'd like using the link in the previous bullet.

Normally all of this is buried in the footer/postscript of these emails, but since we're entering Demuxed SZN we thought we'd give newsletter logistics their moment in the spotlight.

## Whoa Demuxed 2023 has a landing page and everything now: go submit talks

We mentioned the dates in the last newsletter (**October 24-26**), but it always really feels real when the [landing page drops](https://2023.demuxed.com). This year's design was artisanally hand crafted by Matt. We say that to say: if you're wondering why it doesn't look as good, it's not because our usual designer is losing their touch, it's because we wanted to get the v1 live.

<Button href="https://2023.demuxed.com/submit">Submit a talk</Button>

You can go submit a talk now, or shoot us an email if you're interested in sponsoring. Some other quick hit deets if you missed the last newsletter:

- Same venue as last year, Bespoke, with some layout upgrades
- We heard the feedback loud and clear, so we're giving the schedule more breathing room (and not starting before the mall opens). This year is 2.5 days, and kicking things off Tuesday right after lunch.
