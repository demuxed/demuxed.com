This month marked the 10 year anniversary of SF Video Tech! To put 2013 in perspective, here are some other things that happened that year:

- The Edward Snowden leaks
- Higgs Boson was confirmed
- H.265 was finalized as a standard
- VP9 was released
- Vine was launched (although its [pi√®ce de r√©sistance](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/two-bros-chillin-in-a-hot-tub) didn't come until 3 years later)

A decade later, this meetup brought about Demuxed and played a role in starting other meetups and video tech conferences around the world. Many of us have met amazing friends at this meetup and had the opportunity to speak (and work!) with some of the most brilliant minds in video technology. A video meetup **_is_** where [Dinesh and Gilfoyle met Carla Walton](https://stream.new/v/P4Cp9yfQKgWrZN4X00MpcgK602lANkWuvJmkveg0202Fcn4), after all.

**Huge** thank you to everyone that's been involved over the years, both in SF Video and the larger community. If you haven't made it out to a local meetup yet, we highly suggest it, and reach out to the organizer and offer to speak while you're at it. üòâ

## Demuxed

There are still a few talks we're waiting to get final confirmation on from the presenter, but we've got a pretty amazing lineup in hand that we can't wait to show you. The landing page is updated to at least have the teaser for some of the companies that are presenting, but here's a sneak peek at some personal favorite titles:

> Why is your encoder so slow? The curse of next-gen standards

> JavaScript can be the missing spork in ffmpeg's swiss army knife

> When IDR frame insertion backfires

> lo-fi spy: video, steganography, and you

> Low-level wizardry in dav1d

You may have also noticed the gorgeous new sponsor image at the end of this email. Wow. What a fine collection of companies that are out here supporting the ecosystem. If you, two, would like to join them, [let's chat](mailto:sponsor@demuxed.com?subject=We're%20interested%20in%20sponsoring%20Demuxed%202023).

### Open Office Parties

We're also planning to help organize the usual night of **open offices/meetups** on the first night of the conference. These are intentionally loosely organized just as a way for other companies and people to get involved. In past years they've been anything from an impromptu meetup at someone's office to a full-blown meetup with speakers. If you're interested in helping to host one of these events, [shoot us a note](mailto:info@demuxed.com?subject=Let's%20talk%20open%20office%20party).

These events also play nicely as part of‚Ä¶ üëá

## Video Tech Week: SF (we're gonna make the name happen)

We've got confirmation from the HLS Interest group that they're going to hold their meeting on the Friday before Demuxed (October 20th). The Foundations of Open Media Standards (FOMS) is going to meet the following Monday (October 23rd). These two events are an incredible opportunity for the video industry to get together and work on the standards that underlie so much of the work we all do, but they're also both intended to be small, focused, and require engagement. If you're interested in attending, check [Video Dev](https://video-dev.org) or their respective websites and look into whether or not they're a fit for you!
