###Who are we?
To be terribly honest, we're simply engineers talking about video technology. After two years of chatting about video at the [SF Video Technology Meetup,](http://www.meetup.com/SF-Video-Technology/) we've decided it's time for an engineer-first event with quality technical talks about video. Our focus is on video delivered over the web, but topics cover anything from encoding to playback and more!

###Who's organizing this? 
Most of the boring work is being done by engineers from [Brightcove,](https://www.brightcove.com/en/) but there was an amazing group of people from the meetup that we called our "Braintrust". They've been nice enough to do things like schedule planning, vetting the conference name, designing cool swag, and even arguing heatedly over which talk submissions should make the final cut.

This event is run with the help of the members of the SF Video Technology Meetup. We're incredibly lucky to have built up a community of engineers that work on some of the best video products on the web.
